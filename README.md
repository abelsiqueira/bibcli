# bibcli

This is a command line interface to manage references in the format of bibtex
and json.
Our objectives are

- read from/to bibtex to/from json;
- use a machine global database (in json?) to keep all user wanted references;
- generate a local bib file from the global file by reading the tex requirements;
- set a naming convention for references;
- estabilish a user reviewed global repository of references;
- sync with a remote global repository for all validated references.
