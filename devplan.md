# Development Plan

This should help me, and whoever else is interested, to find out what I mean and
want to do.

## Programming Language

I've chosen Ruby. Reasons:

- I want to learn more about it;
- It is (supposed to be) better at handling string/parsing problems.

## Files

### $HOME/.bibclirc

Configuration file for bibcli. Not sure what will be here yet.

### $HOME/.bibcli/user.db

Global machine database for the user required references.

## Use

- `$ bibcli generate TEX`
- `$ bibcli search keyword`
- `$ bibcli remote search keyword`
- `$ bibcli add [class]`
